# My Portfolio

## Description
For this project, I wanted to utilize Bootstrap and CSS to create a mobile-responsive site that would allow visitors to view my portfolio, send me a message, and view my home page from any device. 
I also wanted to incorporate multiple design elements to make the site aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate.
